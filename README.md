# Bitonic-Sort-Algorithm-using-MPI
Bitonic  sort  algorithm  minimizes  the  number  of communication steps and increases the speedup when executed on multiple cores. The resulting algorithm is faster than the Quicksort when implemented in Parallel Computing process.
##  Bitonic Sequence:
A bitonic sequence is a sequence of values a_0, a_1,..a_(n−1) with the property that, there exists an index i, where o≤i≤n-1, such that a_0 through a_i is monotonically increasing and a_i through a_(n−1) is monotonically decreasing.
